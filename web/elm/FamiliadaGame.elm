---- UPDATE ----

-- A description of the kinds of actions that can be performed on the model of
-- our application. See the following post for more info on this pattern and

type Action

    | ChangeVisibility Answer Bool


-- How we update our Model on a given Action?
update : Action -> Model -> Model
update action model =

      -- ShowAnswer aid ->
      --   let showAnswer a = if a.id == aid then { a | visible <- True } else a
      --   in
      --     { model | currentQuestion.answers <- List.map showAnswer currentQuestion.answers }


---- VIEW ----

view : Address Action -> Model -> Html
view address model =
    div
      [ class "jumbotron" ]
      [ text "elo elo 3 5 0" ]


---- INPUTS ----

-- wire the entire application together
main : Signal Html
main =
  Signal.map (view actions.address) model


-- manage the model of our application over time
model : Signal Model
model =
  Signal.foldp update initialModel actions.signal


-- actions from user input
actions : Signal.Mailbox Action
actions =
  Signal.mailbox NoOp
